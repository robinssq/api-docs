Ingesting Product Feeds
-----------------------

In order for Narrativ to accurately match publisher recommendation links to a merchant's product, we require a
comprehensive product feed. Depending on your preference, we can either fetch your feed or you can send it to us via
HTTP, FTP or SFTP using the specifications detailed below. Feeds sent via FTP or SFTP should be scheduled for daily
export.

Formatting
----------

We currently support CSV and XML file formats and zip and gzip compressed files. Please ensure the fields GTIN
(or SKU if unavailable), Product URL and Stock Status are included in the file. You can view a `sample file`_ here.

Send via FTP
------------
Note: Enable passive and binary modes
