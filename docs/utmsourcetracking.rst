UTM Source Tracking
===================

.. _utmsourcetracking_overview:

Overview
--------

Narrativ leverages ``utm_source`` to better segment traffic from syndicated channels, such as Apple News, AMP, or
Social. This is configured as a simple url parameter appended to Narrativ links. Please note, this will not affect the
link’s monetization in any way.

Building a Narrativ Attributed Link
-----------------------------------

There are two ways to append tracking to links so that clicks and revenue connected to these links can be reported:

    1. Create a Narrativ Deeplink that directs to the product link with Narrativ tracking appended - a “Shop link”
    2. Add a click wrapper around a product link so that upon click Narrativ tracking is added - a “Clickmate link”

In both methods, we support ``utm_source`` tracking so that we can report performance by syndicated platform
(e.g, Apple News)

How to add utm_source to Narrativ Deeplinks (Shop Links)

These are links that have been created using the Narrativ Chrome Extension, which follows the format:

To add ``utm_source`` simply append it to the end like this:

Often publishers and creators use u1’s as an additional tracking parameter. Narrativ ``utm_source`` works well with
links that utilize u1’s.

A normal link with u1 would look like:
