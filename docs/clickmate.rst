ClickMate
=========

Overview
--------

ClickMate provides a wrapper that you can use on any link to convert
it, on the fly, to a SmartLink. This means that the link will go through our
matching process, and on future clicks will work through our real time
auction system and will re-route to the most beneficial advertiser.

Your account must be a member of our LinkMate program to use this feature.
For more information about this program, feel free to `contact us`_.



Build a ClickMate Link
----------------------

If you wanted to monetize a link to `https://dermstore.com.example/shop/product1234`
you would put that link in your HTML, or use our Chrome Extension to turn it into a SmartLink.
ClickMate gives you another option. You would wrap the link in the form

`https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdermstore.com.example%2Fshop%2Fproduct1234&publisher_slug=myacct&article_title=my-story`

The first time someone clicks that link, our system will create a SmartLink in your account if
`dermstore.com.example` is one of the domains we handle for you. On subsequent clicks, if the link is
matched and an auction takes place, the destination will be redirected. If there is no auction,
the link will just be redirected to the original URL.

The ideal usage for this is to set up a programmatic integration--either wrap all commerce links
on your site or all of the ones you want Narrativ to monetize. Our system will make sure that
your readers get to the appropriate destination while finding you all the best monetezation opportunities.
If the wrapping happens server side by your CMS, this will even work in no-javascript or ad-blocked
environments like AMP.
